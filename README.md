To strengthen my blockchain and smart contract development skills, I'm building this project while following Udemy's [Build An NFT Marketplace From Scratch - Blockchain DApp](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-nft-marketplace-from-scratch-blockchain-dapp/) course and changing the code I find relevant.

My main goals with this DApp is learning and improving:
- Smart contracts deployment and interaction using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- Web3 implementations in React/NextJS using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- Solidity and Smart Contracts testing

This project is also part of the study I'm doing to create my own Web 3.0 portfolio.

## Demo

# Setup

To avoid import errors in Solidity files when using VSCode Solidity extensions, add
```js
"solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "",
"solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "node_modules"
```
to user's VSCode settings.

* Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
