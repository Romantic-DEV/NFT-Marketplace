To strengthen my blockchain and smart contract development skills, I'm building this project while following Udemy's [Build An NFT Marketplace From Scratch - Blockchain DApp](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-nft-marketplace-from-scratch-blockchain-dapp/) course.

My main goals with this DApp is learning and improving:
- Smart contracts deployment and interaction using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- Web3 implementations in React/NextJS using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- Solidity and Smart Contracts testing

This project is also part of the study I'm doing to create my own Web 3.0 portfolio.
